# Exception Handling
---

***🔹 What is an Exception?***
---
An exception is an error that happens during program execution.

Example:
	•	Dividing by zero
	•	File not found
	•	Element not found in Selenium
	•	NullPointerException
  
---
***🔹 Why would we use throw manually?***

Sometimes we want to stop execution if something is wrong.

---

***if(username == null) {
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Username cannot be null");
}***

## Why try-catch is used?
Try-catch is used to handle runtime exceptions gracefully so that the automation framework does not crash and instead logs the issue properly.

## Where do we use try-catch in automation frameworks?
In our framework, we mainly use try-catch:
- In screenshot handling methods
- In Selenium UI flows, especially while waiting for elements
- While handling dynamic page loading

This helps in preventing runtime failures and improves framework stability.
