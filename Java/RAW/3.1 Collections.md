## Explain internal working of HashMap
---
HashMap is basically used when I want to store data in key–value form and fetch it quickly.
When I put something in a HashMap, Java internally decides where to store it based on the key.
Later, when I ask for the value using the same key, Java directly goes to that place and returns the value.
That’s why HashMap is fast and commonly used.

HashMap uses both hashCode() and equals().
hashCode decides the bucket, equals decides the exact key match.
That ensures correct value retrieval even when collisions happen.
