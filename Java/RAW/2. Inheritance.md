# **Inheritance – SDET Interview Notes**

---

## **Q1. What is inheritance and why do Page classes extend BaseClass?**

**Answer:**
Inheritance allows one class to reuse the variables and methods of another class.  
In my framework, I create a BaseClass that contains WebDriver setup and common utilities like `openUrl()` and waits.  
Page classes extend BaseClass so they inherit driver and reusable methods without rewriting them, which keeps the framework clean and maintainable.

---

## **Q2. Can private variables be inherited? Why?**

**Answer:**
No. Private variables cannot be inherited because their access is limited to the same class only.  
Even if a class extends the parent, private members stay hidden.  
That’s why private locators in POM are only accessible inside the same page class.

---

## **Q3. What keyword is used for inheritance?**

**Answer:**
The keyword used is **extends**.  
One class extends another class to reuse its methods and variables.

---

## **Q4. Why is WebDriver usually protected in the BaseClass?**

**Answer:**
If we make it private, Page classes can’t access it.  
If we make it public, anyone can modify it — which is unsafe.  
So protected gives the right balance between accessibility and security.

---

## **Q5. Can constructors be inherited?**

**Answer:**
No, constructors cannot be inherited.  
They belong to the specific class and are used only to initialize that class’s objects.

---

# **Sample Inheritance Code Example (Interview Demo)**

```java
class BaseClass {
    WebDriver driver;

    void openUrl(String url) {
        driver.get(url);
    }
}

class LoginPage extends BaseClass {

    void login() {
        // using driver inherited from BaseClass
        System.out.println("Login using inherited driver");
    }
}
```
---

**Explanation to Speak in Interview:**
BaseClass contains driver setup and common methods.  
LoginPage extends BaseClass and directly reuses driver and utilities — this is inheritance in my automation framework.

# 📌 Inheritance – Interview Notes 

---

## Q1. Can a child class inherit private variables?

No. Private variables are **NOT inherited** because they are accessible only within the same class.

---

## Q2. Difference between protected and private in inheritance?

👉 **private** → accessible only within the same class  
👉 **protected** → accessible in the same package and in child classes outside the package

---

## Q3. Parent has only parameterized constructor & child does not call super()?

**Compile-time error.**

Yes, it will be a compile-time error because Java tries to call `super()` implicitly, but the parent does not have a default constructor.  
If the parent has only a parameterized constructor, then the child **must** call it explicitly, whether you “need” it or not.

---

## Q4. Why does Java force child to call parent’s parameterized constructor?

Java forces this to ensure the **parent part of the object is properly initialized** before the child object is created.

---

## Q5. Parent has BOTH default + parameterized constructor, child doesn’t call super()

If `super()` is not written, Java always calls the **parent’s default constructor**.

---

## Q6. Can a child class override static methods?

No. Static methods belong to the **class**, not the object, so they cannot be overridden.  
What actually happens is **method hiding**, not overriding.

---

## Q7. Can a child class override a final method?

No. A final method cannot be overridden because final means the implementation is locked and cannot be changed by child classes.

---

## Q8. Can a child reduce access level while overriding?

No. A child class cannot reduce the access level while overriding because it would break polymorphism.  
Access level can be the same or more permissive, not more restrictive.

---

## Q9. Parent method throws Exception, child method overrides it  
Can the child throw:
- a broader exception?
- a narrower exception?
- no exception?

**Answer – While overriding a method:**

❌ Child method **CANNOT** throw a broader checked exception than the parent  
✅ Child method **CAN** throw:
- the same exception  
- a narrower exception  
- no exception at all  

---

## Notes – Exception Hierarchy

```java
Exception
└── IOException
└── FileNotFoundException

- Exception → broader  
- IOException → narrower  
- FileNotFoundException → more narrow

```

So:
- **Broader exception** = higher in hierarchy  
- **Narrower exception** = child of that exception  

---

## Q10. Which of these is valid?

- Parent p = new Child();
- Child c = new Parent();

**Correct answer:**

- ✅ `Parent p = new Child();` → VALID (polymorphism)  
- ❌ `Child c = new Parent();` → INVALID  

Parent doesn’t have child-specific behavior, so child reference cannot point to parent object.

---

## Q11. Why do Page classes extend Base class in automation framework?

Base class contains WebDriver setup and reusable methods.  
Page classes extend it to **avoid duplication** and **reuse code**.

---

## Q12. Is WebDriver usually declared protected in a base class?

Yes. WebDriver is usually declared **protected** so that child page classes can access it while still preventing unrestricted access.
