# 🧪 Selenium Preparation Repository

This repository represents my **hands-on Selenium interview preparation**, built with a strong focus on **DOM understanding, locator strategy, and real automation scenarios**.

Rather than memorizing answers, this repo demonstrates **how I think while solving Selenium problems**, which is exactly what interviewers look for.

## 🎯 CSS Folder — Locator Decision Making

This folder contains questions where a **DOM structure is given**, and the goal is to decide **which CSS selector should be used and why**.

### 🧩 What’s inside:
- ID selectors (`#id`)
- Class selectors (`.class`)
- Tag + class combinations
- Attribute selectors:
  - Starts with (`^=`)
  - Ends with (`$=`)
  - Contains (`*=`)
- Choosing selectors based on:
  - Stability
  - Maintainability
  - Readability

💡 **Interview angle:**  
“How do you choose the best CSS selector when multiple options are available?”

## 🧭 Xpath Folder — DOM Traversal Thinking

This folder focuses on **XPath creation based on DOM relationships**, which is critical when elements are dynamic or poorly structured.

### 🧩 What’s inside:
- Attribute-based XPath
- Text-based XPath
- Parent → Child navigation
- Child → Parent navigation
- Sibling traversal
- Writing relative XPath instead of absolute XPath

💡 **Interview angle:**  
“How do you locate elements when CSS selectors are not reliable?”

## 🧠 Selenium_Questions — Real Interview Scenarios

This folder contains **scenario-based Selenium questions** and **core Selenium concepts**, written exactly the way they are discussed in interviews.

### 🔍 Scenarios covered:
- Hover menu automation
- Window and new-tab handling
- iFrame handling (including payment flows)
- Fluent Wait vs Explicit Wait
- JavaScriptExecutor use cases
- Native vs custom dropdown handling
- Core Selenium fundamentals
- Final-round discussion questions

Each scenario explains:
- The problem
- The automation approach
- The reasoning behind the solution

💡 **Interview angle:**  
“How would you automate this in a real project?”

## 🚀 Why This Repository Exists

It is a:
- Structured **interview-prep workspace**
- Reference for **real automation discussions**
- Reflection of **production-level Selenium thinking**
